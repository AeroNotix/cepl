Code Evaluate Play Loop

My first lisp project, a chance to play about and get something up in opengl.

-----

**Requires**

cl-opengl
lispbuilder
glop

All the above are available from quicklisp

freeglut (requires by cl-opengl)
xrandr (required by glop)

I got these from my system's (Ubuntu's) package manager
