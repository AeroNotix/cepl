'cgl:make-vao' uses buffer formats to bind-vertex-attrib-pointers
and also to enable-vertex-attrib-arrays....that is a problem for
at least the latter as one interleaved array can be multiple 
attributes
--------------------
buffer 1:
position 
color

buffer 2:
normal

buffer 3:
tex-data

3 buffers
4 array-formats
4 attributes
--------------------
buffer 1:
position - color
normal

buffer 2:
tex-data

2 buffers
3 array-formats
4 attributes
--------------------
I made some changes but I actually need independant binding. 
So I need to really rethink how this is done.

define attribute-format or interleaved-attribute-format
make c-array using format 
populate c-array with data using destructuring-populate
populate-buffer with c-array/s - This needs to spit out 
		     	         a buffer-attributes...or 
				 some other name
make-vao takes the buffer-attributes and binds them in turn

--------------------
I have now killed the bind-clause stuff and so cepl will not
work now!

next I need to:
* rename everything
* rework buffer-data to give the buffer-attributes we need
* rework make-vao to handle calling attrib-pointer itself
* Put head between legs and kiss nethers goodbye
