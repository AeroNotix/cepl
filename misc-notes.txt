buffers
-------
as usual, these are just blocks of unformatted data

stream
------
Based around VAOs
Streams have a stream-format 

stream-format
-------------
this is used to work out vars, stride and all the rest
based around a struct...somehow
DO we want this to be a stream format...why not data format?
My thinking is that we will want this to reorder the elements
depending on the best memory layout practices.

program
-------
make-program will spit of a lambda which will render using the
pipeline contained. its arguments are those of the vertex shader.
It will expext uniforms and a list of render-jobs

renderable
----------
stream with the bounds of the data so you could have multiple
object mesh data in one buffer and use this to define a 'stream'
for each one.
