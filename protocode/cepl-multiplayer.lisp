How do we make cepl truely multiplayer?

Well we need to be able to handle multiple people working on the same source file. (Look at Rudel). We need those people to be able to compile the code into the running program (can swank handle this?). We need to make sure there is an editor that is not Emacs that can do this (This is hard, do we embed emacs in something else and minimise the functionality?).

see mrepl, piped input for slime.

We need artists to be able to interact with assets in the running game.

We need people to be able to play in the level at the same time (multiplayer connections) even if just viewing.

We need to tools that can manipulate the world in real-time.

We have a host of devices these days: tablets, phones, motion controllers, 3D scanners, wacom like devices... what can we do to pour data into our worlds?

Artists, gameplay, music, story, dialog...

Inject code, data, media
